## Building
You can build Superlumen on the following operating systems:
- Debian Linux: Stretch

In general, you should be able to build on other OS's with no or little modification.

### Steps
Make sure you have the latest version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, at the moment, we are using node v8.9.1.

1. Clone this repository and open a console in the directory.
2. Run ```npm install```
3. Run ```npm run start```
4. You did it! Superlumen should be up and running.

#### Creating Executables & Packages
This project is loosely supporting Windows, Mac, Linux, and FreeBSD. Our team is too small to test all OS's, so if you discover a problem, please report it in our project [issues](https://github.com/super-lumen/superlumen-gui/issues).

Creating the executables is done simply by running:   
```npm run dist```  

We leverage the [electron](https://electronjs.org/) to compile and power the app itself, and [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to perform packaging.

#### Linux (Debian)
On Debian systems you may need to install additional packaging tools if you want to generate a distribution.

Running ```sudo apt install build-essential rpm bsdtar icnsutils imagemagick``` should ensure you have the right tools.

##### Generating Mac/Windows Icons
To regenerate the Mac and Windows icon files from the icon PNGs you should run the npm script ```icons```.

Example: ```npm run icons```

For the Mac icon generation the script requires the png2icns program from the debian icnsutils package. 
You can install the package by running: ```sudo apt install icnsutils```.

For Windows icon generation imagemagick is required.
You can install the package by running: ```sudo apt install imagemagick```.
